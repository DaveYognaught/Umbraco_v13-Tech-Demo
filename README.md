Very quick tech demo of Umbraco V13 utilizing a combination of different Bootstrap templates to showcase a fictional company. 
Emphasis on using Umbraco Blockgrids and Blocklists and every single element being editable within Umbraco. 

Estimated time of completion: 8 hours. 
This was my first venture into ASP.NET Core and Umbraco V13. Very transferrable skillset from this short demo. 
Was fun to utilize my prior experience and knowledge and to prove that a lot of what i've learned can be reapplied. 

Biggest challenge was the Blockgrid custom renderer; this was the 'newest' thing I had to learn and was most unfamiliar with. (Content Grid on previous versions of Umbraco, only a small overlap though!)
Given 3 possible choices of rendering this (built-in renderer, a razor template + macro or full custom) this was the most complicated and the least documented, but I prevailed nonethless. 
The result of this is a truly bespoke and fully developer controlled design of when and where the code renders, ensuring access to all relevant Umbraco fields. 
It also prevents the need for template files, macros, etc. So the project is a lot easier to manage.
